# Disaster Recovery Rehearsal & Backup Validation Policy

## Overview

This document establishes the official Disaster Recovery (DR) rehearsal checklist, backup validation procedures, and critical service recovery flows for the NeuroWealth Backend.

## 1. Backup Scope & Retention Policy

### Backup Scope

| Resource | Scope / Items Included | Backup Type | Frequency | RPO Target | RTO Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary Database | PostgreSQL schema, transactional data, user tables, audit logs | Automated Snapshots + WAL Archiving | Continuous (WAL) / Daily Snapshot | < 15 minutes | < 1 hour |
| Key Custody | Wallet encryption keys, JWT seeds, API secrets | Secret Manager Versioning / Offline Vault | On creation / rotation | < 0 minutes | < 15 minutes |
| Redis Cache & Queues | Outbox operations, DLQ metadata, rate limits | RDB Snapshots | Hourly | < 1 hour | < 30 minutes |
| System Configuration | Deployment manifests, env templates, app configs | Git repository + Config Store | Version controlled | < 0 minutes | < 15 minutes |

### Retention Windows

- **Daily Database Snapshots**: Retained for 30 days.
- **Monthly Database Snapshots**: Retained for 365 days.
- **Audit Chains & Compliance Data**: Retained for 7 years in cold storage (per `DATA_RETENTION_POLICY.md`).
- **WAL Logs**: Retained for 14 days to support point-in-time recovery (PITR).

## 2. Recovery Decision Points & SLA

### Key Decision Matrix

| Trigger Event | Initial Assessment | Action / Decision | Decision Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary DB Unreachable | Connection timeout > 3 mins | Failover to Read Replica or Restore PITR | Database Administrator |
| Data Corruption Detected | Corrupted block/row count > 0 | Freeze write traffic & initiate PITR restore | Incident Commander |
| Regional Outage | Full cloud region failure | Activate secondary region failover | Infrastructure Lead |
| Encryption Key Compromise | Unauthorized key access | Key rotation + database re-encryption | Security Lead |

### Target Recovery Metrics

- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum allowable data loss: **15 minutes**.
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Maximum allowable service downtime: **60 minutes**.

## 3. Owner Assignments & Responsibilities

| Role | Primary Owner | Secondary Owner | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| Incident Commander (IC) | DevOps Lead | Platform Lead | Coordinates DR response, manages communications, authorizes failover. |
| Database Administrator (DBA) | Lead DBA | Sr Backend Engineer | Manages database snapshots, executes PITR restore, validates schema integrity. |
| Infrastructure Lead | Cloud Architect | DevOps Engineer | Handles DNS failover, secret provisioning, and container cluster redeploy. |
| Security Lead | CISO / Security Lead | Compliance Officer | Verifies key material integrity, audits data access, clears production restart. |

## 4. Disaster Recovery Rehearsal Checklist

### Phase 1: Pre-Rehearsal Preparation

- [ ] Declare DR rehearsal window and notify engineering & ops teams.
- [ ] Confirm latest automated snapshot exists and pass integrity check.
- [ ] Provision isolated sandbox environment for DR rehearsal (do not run against production).
- [ ] Verify secret manager keys (`WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`) in test environment.

### Phase 2: Execution & Restore Flow

- [ ] **Step 1**: Trigger simulated failure (e.g., terminate primary DB instance in test sandbox).
- [ ] **Step 2**: Restore PostgreSQL database from latest snapshot or WAL point-in-time.
- [ ] **Step 3**: Verify database schema migrations and run `npx prisma migrate status`.
- [ ] **Step 4**: Validate wallet key decryption sanity check using test wallet payloads.
- [ ] **Step 5**: Clear/warm Redis queue states and verify outbox processing capability.
- [ ] **Step 6**: Start application backend instances and execute `scripts/smoke-health.sh`.

### Phase 3: Validation & Sign-off

- [ ] Execute automated validation script: `npx ts-node scripts/validate-backup-restore.ts`.
- [ ] Verify data completeness and count checks against pre-failure metrics.
- [ ] Measure total RTO and RPO achieved during rehearsal.
- [ ] Document rehearsal outcome in the incident post-mortem log.
- [ ] Obtain sign-off from Incident Commander and Security Lead.

## 5. Automated Backup & Restore Validation Script

Run the automated backup validation harness:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/validate-backup-restore.ts
```

The script verifies:
1. Database connectivity and table schema completeness.
2. Wallet encryption key availability and decryption integrity.
3. Backup snapshot timestamp and WAL lag (< 15 mins).
4. System health readiness endpoint status.
