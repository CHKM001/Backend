# Dependency & Security Audit Backlog

Tracks the health of every direct dependency, known advisories, and the
remediation plan needed for production readiness. Refs
[#467](https://github.com/Neurowealth/Backend/issues/467).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Last audited** | 2026-09-27 |
| **Next review** | 2026-10-27 (monthly, and whenever CI's audit gate fails) |
| **Owner** | Backend maintainers ([CODEOWNERS](../.github/CODEOWNERS): @BernardOnuh) |
| **Tree size** | 29 runtime + 25 dev direct deps; 434 packages in the production tree, 847 in total |

## How to re-run the audit

```bash
npm ci
npm run audit:deps       # npm audit, fails on moderate or above
npm run outdated:deps    # npm outdated (exits 0; informational)
npm audit --omit=dev     # runtime-only exposure
```

CI enforcement is unchanged: `node-ci.yml` blocks merges on **high/critical**
advisories and on copyleft licences, and Dependabot opens grouped weekly PRs
for minor/patch updates. The weekly
[`dependency-audit`](../.github/workflows/dependency-audit.yml) workflow
uploads the full `npm audit` / `npm outdated` JSON as an artifact so this
document can be refreshed from real data.

## Known advisories

| Advisory | Package (path) | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [GHSA-4mjr-xmp4-gh2g](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4mjr-xmp4-gh2g): DoS via attacker-controlled `isBuffer` | `qs` 6.15.3 (via `express` 4.22.2, `body-parser` 1.20.6) | Moderate | **Fixed**: lockfile now resolves `qs` 6.16.0, `express` 4.22.3, `body-parser` 1.20.8 |
| [GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx): array-limit bypass via bracket-key comma parsing | `qs` 6.15.3 (same path) | Moderate | **Fixed** (same upgrade) |

`npm audit` after remediation: **0 vulnerabilities** (0 low, 0 moderate,
0 high, 0 critical).

## High-risk packages: owners and target versions

Priority is based on runtime exposure, whether the installed line is still
supported upstream, and how far behind it is.

| Priority | Package(s) | Installed → Target | Why it is high-risk | Owner | Target date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | `@prisma/client`, `prisma` | 5.22.0 → 7.10.x | Two majors behind. `@prisma/instrumentation` is already on 7.x, so tracing runs against a mismatched client major. Needs a migration dry run against staging. | Backend maintainers | 2026-11-30 |
| P1 | `express`, `@types/express` | 4.22.3 → 5.2.x | Core HTTP surface. The `qs`/`body-parser` advisory chain above came in through Express 4. Express 5 changes path matching and async error handling, so every router needs a regression pass. | Backend maintainers | 2026-12-31 |
| P1 | `@stellar/stellar-sdk` | 16.2.0 → 17.1.x | Signs and submits on-chain transactions. SDK majors follow Stellar protocol upgrades; falling behind risks rejected transactions after a network upgrade. | Backend maintainers | 2026-11-15 |
| P2 | `@sentry/node`, `@sentry/profiling-node` | 10.71.0 → 11.x | Error reporting. The profiling native addon is tied to Node ABI versions. | Backend maintainers | 2026-12-31 |
| P2 | `ioredis` | 5.11.1 → 6.x | Backs rate limiting and caching on auth-adjacent paths. | Backend maintainers | 2027-01-31 |
| P2 | `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | 0.112.5 → 0.128.x | Pre-1.0, so every minor may break; talks to an external paid API. | Backend maintainers | 2026-12-31 |
| P2 | `eslint` | 8.57.1 → 9.x / 10.x | ESLint 8 is end-of-life. The repo already uses flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`), which makes this upgrade simpler. Dev-only. | Backend maintainers | 2026-12-31 |
| P2 | `@types/node`, `typescript` | `@types/node` 20 → 22; hold `typescript` on 5.9.x | `@types/node` 20 does not match `engines.node >=22` or the `node:22` Docker image. Hold the TypeScript 7 major until the existing type errors below are fixed. | Backend maintainers | 2026-10-31 |
| P3 | OpenTelemetry (`sdk-node`, `exporter-trace-otlp-http`, `auto-instrumentations-node`) | 0.220 / 0.78 → 0.222 / 0.80 | Pre-1.0 packages whose minors can break. Upgrade them together as one group. | Backend maintainers | 2026-11-30 |
| P3 | `dotenv`, `jest`, `@types/jest`, `supertest` | see inventory | Low runtime exposure (`dotenv`) or dev-only. | Backend maintainers | 2027-03-31 |

### Blocking issue found during the audit

`npx tsc --noEmit` currently fails on `main` (3 errors in the
`tsconfig.build.json` scope), left over from the zod 4 migration:
`z.record(z.any())` in `src/validators/webhook-validators.ts` needs an
explicit key schema, and `src/controllers/user-webhook-controller.ts` passes a
nullable record into a Prisma `Json` field. This also stops the test suites
that load the full app from compiling. It must be fixed before any of the
TypeScript, Prisma or Express upgrades above can be verified.

## Security exceptions

Each exception is a deliberate deviation from "latest supported version".
Every exception is reviewed at each monthly audit and removed as soon as its
exit condition is met.

| Exception | Reason | Exit condition | Last reviewed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `overrides.axios: ^1.18.0` | Forces a patched `axios` under transitive dependents that pin older ranges. | Every parent package's own range resolves to a patched release. | 2026-09-27 |
| `overrides.brace-expansion: 5.0.9` | Pins a patched transitive `brace-expansion` used by glob tooling. | Parents depend on a fixed range. | 2026-09-27 |
| `overrides.ip-address: ^10.5.0` | Forces a patched transitive `ip-address`. | Parents depend on a fixed range. | 2026-09-27 |
| `overrides.js-yaml: ^4.3.1` under `eslint`, `@eslint/eslintrc`, `@istanbuljs/load-nyc-config` | These dev tools pull older js-yaml lines. The runtime uses js-yaml 5.x directly. | The ESLint 9+ / Jest 30 upgrades above remove the old parents. | 2026-09-27 |
| Moderate/low advisories do not block CI | CI gates on high/critical so that unfixable transitive moderates do not freeze merges. Moderates are tracked in this document instead. | Revisit once the P1 upgrades land; consider tightening the gate to `moderate`. | 2026-09-27 |
| Dependabot ignores major bumps | Majors need a deliberate, reviewed upgrade PR (see the table above). | Permanent policy. | 2026-09-27 |

## Remediation done in this audit

- `npm audit fix` (non-breaking): `express` 4.22.2 → 4.22.3, `body-parser`
  1.20.6 → 1.20.8, `qs` 6.15.3 → 6.16.0, which clears both `qs` advisories.
- Moved `@types/node-cron` and `@types/supertest` from `dependencies` to
  `devDependencies`. They are compile-time only but were being installed into
  the production image by `npm ci --omit=dev`.
- Added the `audit:deps` / `outdated:deps` npm scripts and a weekly
  non-blocking `dependency-audit` workflow.

## Dependency inventory

"Breaking update available" means a new major, or a new minor for `0.x`
packages. Non-breaking updates are picked up by Dependabot's grouped weekly PRs.
