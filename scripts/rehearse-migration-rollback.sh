# rehearse-migration-rollback.sh — Prove the rollback path works before needing it.
#
# The question a rollback rehearsal exists to answer is narrow and concrete:
# "if I have to reverse this migration tonight, does the reverse SQL actually
# undo it, and does the forward SQL then re-apply cleanly?" This script proves
# exactly that, for any migration, without needing to know anything about it.
#
# It deliberately does NOT touch Prisma's migration history. Marking a migration
# as rolled back and hoping `migrate deploy` restores it depends on undocumented
# `_prisma_migrations` semantics (Prisma 5's `migrate resolve --rolled-back`
# refuses outright with P3012 for a migration that applied successfully, and
# re-applying leaves several history rows in states the CLI does not
# round-trip). Every one of those failure modes has the same nasty property:
# the columns are gone, the history still says "applied", and the next deploy is
# a silent no-op. Applying the SQL directly proves the same thing while leaving
# the database exactly as it was found.
#
# Usage:
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... bash scripts/rehearse-migration-rollback.sh
#
# Options (env):
#   CI=1                Skip the interactive confirmation prompts.
#   MIGRATION=<name>    Rehearse a specific migration instead of the newest applied one.
#
# Exit codes: 0 if the full apply → rollback → re-apply round trip succeeded.
