#!/usr/bin/env bash
# rollback-migration.sh — Reverse a single Prisma migration using its rollback.sql.
#
# Prisma migrations are forward-only; there is no built-in "down". This script
# applies the hand-written rollback.sql that ships next to each migration's
# migration.sql, then marks the migration as rolled back in Prisma's history so
# `prisma migrate deploy` can re-apply it later.
#
# The history update must not be skipped: without it the schema is reverted but
# the history still reports the migration as applied, so the next deploy is a
# no-op and the mismatch goes unnoticed.
#
# Usage:
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... bash scripts/rollback-migration.sh <migration-name>
#
# Example:
#   DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL bash scripts/rollback-migration.sh 20260627_add_transaction_events
#
# Options (env):
#   CI=1                 Skip the interactive confirmation prompt.
#   HEALTHCHECK_URL=...   If set, curl this URL after rollback (expects HTTP 200).
#
# Exit codes: 0 on success, non-zero on any failure.
